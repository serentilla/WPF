# WPF
Moving a few files over from BitBucket. I chose BitBucket at the time because it allowed private repositories long before Github did. It has not aged well in my opinion.

I did the first version of this back in probably about 2009ish, then updated it later to include new controls in 4.0. Currently it has no new controls added to WPF after 4.0.
I hope it's informative and useful, I still use it as a reference, and it's been helpful when mentoring.
